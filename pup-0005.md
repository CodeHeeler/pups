## Summary

This proposal adopts the GPL Cooperation Commitment (GPLCC) for the
Pulp project.

## Motivation

GPLv2 features an "automatic termination" provision, triggered by any
license violation, which may in some cases cause even well-meaning
users to lose their rights under the GPL if they fail to comply fully
with the requirements of the license. In recent years, one GPLv2
project developer in one jurisdiction has based an enforcement
strategy around taking advantage of automatic termination in ways that
many in the technology industry see as abusive.

Concern about the harshness of the GPLv2 termination policy led the
Free Software Foundation to modify it in GPLv3 by adding a 60-day
period of repose and a 30-day cure provision for first-time violators,
giving users an opportunity to correct noncompliance and get their
licenses automatically reinstated.

In October 2017 the Linux Foundation Technical Advisory Board adopted
a statement on GPLv2 enforcement policy, containing a commitment to
extend the cure and repose provisions of GPLv3 to users of the Linux
kernel. As of this date over 100 Linux kernel developers have signed
on to this
[statement](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/process/kernel-enforcement-statement.rst).

In November 2017, a coalition of companies led by Red Hat
[announced](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/technology-industry-leaders-join-forces-increase-predictability-open-source-licensing)
that they were adopting a similar commitment, the GPLCC, for all of
their copyrighted code that was licensed under GPLv2, LGPLv2.0 and
LGPLv2.1. Red Hat persuaded an additional set of companies to
[adopt](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/momentum-builds-new-wave-technology-industry-leaders-join-efforts-increase-predictability-open-source-licensing)
the GPLCC in March 2018.

Red Hat would like to encourage projects to adopt the GPLCC as
well. The issue is relevant for projects maintained or led by Red Hat
developers for a few reasons: (1) GPLv2 and LGPLv2.x are licenses that
many Red Hat developers continue to prefer; (2) projects led by Red
Hat developers accept contributions under the project license (as
opposed to an asymmetrical contributor license agreement); and (3)
traditionally Red Hat developers have exercised broad discretion on
project licensing policy.

Pulp is a good candidate for adoption of the GPLCC at the project
level. Pulp is a GPLv2-licensed community project of commercial
significance to Red Hat, and Pulp has been making significant efforts
to build a community around the project, which over time will
encourage contributions to the project from various copyright holders.

## GPL Cooperation Commitment, Version 1.0

GPL Cooperation Commitment
Version 1.0

Before filing or continuing to prosecute any legal proceeding or claim
(other than a Defensive Action) arising from termination of a Covered
License, we commit to extend to the person or entity ('you') accused
of violating the Covered License the following provisions regarding
cure and reinstatement, taken from GPL version 3. As used here, the
term 'this License' refers to the specific Covered License being
enforced.

    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
    license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
    provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
    and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
    copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
    reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you
    have received notice of violation of this License (for any work)
    from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30
    days after your receipt of the notice.

We intend this Commitment to be irrevocable, and binding and
enforceable against us and assignees of or successors to our
copyrights.

Definitions

'Covered License' means the GNU General Public License, version 2
(GPLv2), the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1
(LGPLv2.1), or the GNU Library General Public License, version 2
(LGPLv2), all as published by the Free Software Foundation.

'Defensive Action' means a legal proceeding or claim that We bring
against you in response to a prior proceeding or claim initiated by
you or your affiliate.

'We' means each contributor to this repository as of the date of
inclusion of this file, including subsidiaries of a corporate
contributor.

## Displaying the GPLCC

A file named COMMITMENT will be added to the root of the Pulp git
repository, in the same directory as the LICENSE file. Other Pulp
project repositories using GPLv2 or LGPLv2.1 are encouraged to
include a copy of the same file.

## Drawbacks

None.

## Alternatives

### Continue use of GPLv2 without the GPLCC

The Pulp project can continue to use GPLv2 without adding the
GPLCC. Addition of the GPLCC provides a reduction in risk of unfair GPL
enforcement against users of Pulp, but this was not a large risk to
begin with. The major expected impact of adoption of the GPLCC is its
influence on general norms around GPLv2 interpretation and enforcement
in the larger open source community.

### Relicense Pulp to an open source license with a cure provision

The Pulp project could relicense from GPLv2 to GPLv3, which would
eliminate any point in adopting the GPLCC since GPLv3 already has the
cure and repose provisions. Such relicensing is probably possible
though might take some time to effectuate, and may not be preferred by
the Pulp developers or community.

The Pulp project could also relicense to a mainstream open source
license with a cure provision outside the GPL family, which would
basically mean the Eclipse Public License 2.0 or the Mozilla Public
License 2.0. However this would signify a significant change in
license policy (comparable to switching to LGPL).

### Relicense Pulp to a noncopyleft license

Noncopyleft licenses like the Apache License 2.0 and the MIT license
do not address termination at all (and currently see no known active
license enforcement). Relicensing Pulp to such a license may be
possible but would represent a major change in project licensing
policy.
