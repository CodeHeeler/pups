## Summary

This proposal is to require two-factor authentication (2FA) for members of the Pulp organization in
Github[0]. For more information about 2FA, how Github supports it, and how you can enable it,
you can visit the following URL:

https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication/


## Motivation

With the usage of Travis to automatically build and release our Pulp 3 packages to PyPI, it's
possible that someone with access to a Pulp user account could use Github to deploy malicious code
to our users. Thus, it's necessary to require stringent security settings for our organization.


## Detailed Design

Github provides the ability to require two-factor authentication (2FA) for organizations on Github:

https://help.github.com/articles/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization/

If this PUP is accepted, we will enable this setting for the Pulp organization.


## Drawbacks

The main drawback is that if we enable the requirement for two-factor authentication, some of our
members may not be able to use or may not choose to use two-factor authentication, and thus they
cannot belong to the Github organization. However, these users can still participate in all other
related activities: mailing list discussions, submitting PRs, filing issues, reviewing code, etc.


## Alternatives

One possible alternative is to adopt a policy where we require 2FA without actually requiring it in
Github. However, this requires an admin to regularly check whether users have 2FA enabled or not.


## Rollout

If this PUP is accepted, an initial announcement should be made to the pulp-dev mailing list giving
users a window of 2 weeks in which to enable 2FA. After the two weeks, the setting requiring 2FA
will be enabled in our Github org.
