## Summary

This PUP documents docstring style conventions for Pulp 3.0.

## Motivation

To improve docstring readability and increase information density.

## Details

Upon acceptance, these changes will be documented in the Pulp style guide.

### Style Choices

Docstrings should generally follow the conventions provided in the comments section of the
[Google style guide.](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Comments#Comments)

Additionally, docstrings must be parsable by the
[Napoleon plugin for Sphinx.](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/napoleon.html)

### Additions/Exceptions

Pulp conventions that differ from the `Comments` section of the Google style guide will be
explicitly included in the Pulp style guide.

1. Modules will not contain license information. Our license information is presented correctly
within the project; it is unnecessary to include it in each file.

2. The type of each `Arg` value should be included after the variable name in parentheses. The type of each `Returns` value should be the first item on the line. 

3. Following the type of `Arg` and `Return` values, there will be a colon and a single space
followed by the description.

### Porting from Pulp 2.Y

The 3.0 development guide will be updated to state that all ported code should contain updated
docstrings. Regular expressions to ease large changes will be included there.

## Drawbacks:

It will take time to convert each docstrings into the new style.

## Alternatives

Some alternatives that have been discussed include:

1. Tabular style to align types and descriptions.
2. Requiring new code to follow conventions, but allowing ported code to use the old convention.
