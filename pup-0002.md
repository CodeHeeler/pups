## Summary

This PUP adopts Google's Python docstring style for Pulp 3+.

## Motivation

Pulp 2.Y docstrings use the standard Sphinx style, which is not very readable for humans. They
contain redundant words like `param` and they use an extra line for the `type` of every variable.
Most current Pulp developers find Google style docstrings to be more readable.

## Docstring Style

Docstrings should follow the conventions documented in the
[Comments section](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Comments#Comments)
of the Google Python Style Guide. Exceptions and clarifications will be explicitly stated in the
Pulp style guide.

### Exceptions and Clarifications

1. Modules should not include license information.

2. The type of each `Arg` value should be included after the variable name in parentheses. The type
of each `Returns` value should be the first item on the line.

3. Following the type of `Arg` and `Returns` values, there will be a colon and a single space
followed by the description. Additional spaces should not be used to align types and descriptions.

4. `Fields` and `Relations` sections will be used when documenting fields on Django models.
The `Fields` section will be used for non-related fields on Model classes, the `Relations`
section will be used for related fields on Model classes.

### Example

    The first section is a summary, which should be restricted to a single line.

    More detailed information follows the summary after a blank line. This section can be as many
    line as necessary.

    Args:
        arg1 (str): The argument is visible, and its type is clearly indicated.
        much_longer_argument (str): Types and descriptions are not aligned.
    Returns:
        bool: The return value and type is very clearly visible.

### Language

"Google style docstrings" is the preferred way to refer to the style changes outlined here. It
should be noted that the phrase "Napoleon style docstrings" was originally used. Using the term
"Napoleon" is clear because it accepts docstrings of multiple styles.

### Requirements

Docstrings will be used for auto-documentation and must be parsable by the
[Napoleon plugin for Sphinx.](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/napoleon.html)


### Porting from Pulp 2.Y

The 3.0 development guide will be updated to state that all ported code should contain updated
docstrings. Regular expressions to ease large changes will be included there.

### Putting It Into Practice

Upon acceptance, the following actions will be taken:

1. The Pulp style guide will be updated to include Google style docstrings.
2. Docs will be built with the Napoleon plugin which supports this style and the standard
Sphinx style.
3. The [developer wiki](https://pulp.plan.io/projects/pulp/wiki/#Pulp-30-development) will be
updated to include docstring porting guidelines.


## Alternative: Use Standard Sphinx Style Docstrings (Keep Current Style)

Pros:
  - 2.Y docstrings could be moved without modification.
  - The Google Python Docstring Style may not be widely adopted and understood.

Cons:
  - Standard Sphinx docstrings are not very readable for humans.
  - Standard Sphinx docstrings contain redundant words like `param`.
  - The `type` of each param takes up its own line.
  - Pulp 2.Y docstrings are inconsistent and vary in their use of `:param` and `@param`.

## Alternative: Adopt New Style For New Code Only

When old code is ported, docstrings could be left in the standard Sphinx style.

Pros:
  - For auto-documentation, standard Sphinx and Google style docstrings are equivalent.
  - This option is less work front.

Cons:
  - It is less readable to have multiple styles in the same code base.
  - It could be confusing to developers to know when they should or must update an old docstring to the new style.

## Alternative: Tabular style

These guidelines (but not Google's style guide) specify the use a single space after the type of
`Arg` and `Returns` values. A variation of Google style uses extra spaces to vertically align the
types of objects.

Example:

    Args:
        arg1                 (str): Lots of space to align with second arg
        much_longer_argument (str): If I change this line, I have to change first line too


Pros:
  - Some developers find this more readable.

Cons:
  - Small changes in docstrings often require changing multiple lines to keep them aligned.
